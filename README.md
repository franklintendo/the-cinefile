# Project 1: Movie Recommender

## User Story

We have all sat down in front of our screens to this dilemma: What To Watch? 
Sifting through thousands of movies and searching the titles online for their ratings. 
Our app solves this issue. 
Only displaying top rated movies, we allow the user to filter movies by genre, date, and film audience.
Mobile-friendly and user friendly, the movie lover scrolls through a visual of movie choices focused on their wants.
